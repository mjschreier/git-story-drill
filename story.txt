There once was a person named Sam.
Sam loved to go visit her grandmother deep in the forest.
However, navigating through the depths of this mysterious forest is no easy task.
There are many deep rivers, dark caves, short ledges, and even wild animals.
One rainy afternoon, Sam set out to visit her grandmother and entered the cave of trials at the 
entrance to the forest.
