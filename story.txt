There once was a person named Sam.
Sam loved to go visit her grandmother deep in the forest.
However, navigating through the depths of this mysterious forest is no easy task.
There are many deep rivers, dark caves, short ledges, and even wild animals.
One rainy afternoon, Sam set out to visit her grandmother and entered the cave of trials at the 
entrance to the forest.
The cave is made up of seven trials for each of the seven deadly sins, and only the purest of hearts are able to
pass without being harmed.
Sam entered the gluttony cavern, full of bright, tasty yet poisonous mushrooms growing on the walls.
Sam fortunately has an allergy to mushrooms and cruised on past this delicious cavern. The next area she came upon 
was a page pulled out of Mr. Christian Grey's hand book.
Sam had to close her eyes to block out Mr. Grey's toned six-pack and ropes to get into the greed cavern,
a large space housing thousands of gold coins tainted with deadly anthrax.
Sam at first taken by all the riches walked close to a pile, but as she reached to pick up one she snapped out of
the trans. She ran as fast as she could till she came to a room with all her accomplishments, and she soon 
started to feel she was unstoppable.
But she knew if she stayed in the room for more than 60 seconds, the floor would open up to an
endless pit. Instead, she hurried into the next cavern, a large futuristic-looking cavern with a
locked door on one end. She approached the pedestal in the center, which held a computer and a USB
port (the old kind, not USB type C). She knew that to unlock the door, she must attempt to insert 
the USB properly into the computer. However, the USB was designed not to be insertable either 
direction. Her wrath, expressed by raising her voice would have trapped her in there forever.
After a few minutes of quiet in the room, the door unlocked, satisfied that her wrath was not
revealed.
