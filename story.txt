There once was a person named Sam.
Sam loved to go visit her grandmother deep in the forest.
However, navigating through the depths of this mysterious forest is no easy task.
There are many deep rivers, dark caves, short ledges, and even wild animals.
One rainy afternoon, Sam set out to visit her grandmother and entered the cave of trials at the 
entrance to the forest.
The cave is made up of seven trials for each of the seven deadly sins, and only the purest of hearts are able to
pass without being harmed.
Sam entered the gluttony cavern, full of bright, tasty yet poisonous mushrooms growing on the walls.
